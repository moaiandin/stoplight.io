        With our Visual Test Editor, create multi-step test scenarios to automate
        testing your REST web APIs. Build scenarios by capturing and passing data
        between test API calls. Then integrate your test scenarios into your
        existing CI/CD pipeline with our command line tool, powered by Prism.

        Create test collections that ensure the API implementation meets the
        standards and definitions described in your OpenAPI Specification or JSON
        Schema, also known as Contract Testing. Stoplight uses realistic, dynamic
        data based on your OpenAPI Specification to simulate real-life API
        consumers across your local development, staging, and production
        environments complementing your Unit tests.

        With integrated Contract Testing reporting capabilities, you can track
        your progress towards 100% coverage. Stoplight verifies that the API
        responses for different status codes match the contract of a connected
        OpenAPI Specification; enabling collaboration over API test coverage
        within your organization.

    Increase the test coverage of your web APIs so they break less for your
    consumers. Create a full collection of tests with Stoplight Testing. Use
    Environment and Context Variables to reference other complex test scenarios
    to accelerate test generations and reduce duplication. Test just one API
    call or a scenario of API calls working together in a real-life use case.
