        Stoplight offers multiple ways for your API consumers to try out your
        API. Test Requests within your documentation allows consumers to
        understand how your API works. Code Examples generated from dozens of
        languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, cURL, and more allow
        consumers to copy and paste right into their own code.
