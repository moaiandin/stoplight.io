        Stoplight is the best of both worlds. Yes, we can create a beautiful API
        documentation, and yes, we can create a beautiful generic technical
        documentation that requires actual sentences, screenshots, files and
        more. We can prepare and publish both documentation in one place and
        easily deliver documentation to the clients and third party developers.

## Bodevâ€™s Bind

Bodev was looking for an API Design and Documentation tool that allowed them to create internal API documentation geared towards developers with an integrated method for creating technical documentation for clients. Most of the existing products only solved one of the two problems in depth.

## The Stoplight Strategy

Stoplight provided Bodev with a single source of truth for their API documentation and technical documentation. They could prepare, revise, version, and update their documentation within one editor. This allowed them to integrate their documentation process into their entire software development lifecycle. They then started integrating in mocking (Prism) in their design process to allow front-end developers the ability to start testing their UI before the back-end developers finished planning the backend coding. Testing followed soon after, which increased their development speed substantially.
