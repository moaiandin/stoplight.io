      quote: >-
        We decided to go for Stoplight because we are convinced that the API
        must be held by the business people (product owners). Before, they were
        used to designing processes or UI screens. Now, the screens are made by
        UX experts or by fintechs using our APIs. So, the product owners have to
        design the API, it's an important change, not all of them are ready.
        This is why a graphical tools is a good opportunity, perhaps the only
        one, to involve them in the design of API.

        Stoplight addresses the needs of API Development holistically with a
        strong emphasis on visual modelling and collaboration. It covers API
        Prototyping, Mocking, Specification, Shared Schemas, Documentation,
        Testing and Developer Portal generation - all customisable.
