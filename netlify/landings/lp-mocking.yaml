      title: Instant Mock Server
      description: >-
        Supercharge any OpenAPI Specification with Stoplight Mocking. Once you
        have created or imported your OpenAPI Specification, you have access to an
        instant mock server, which automatically reloads when your specification
        changes. A mock API simulates the behavior of a real API allowing
        collaboration and feedback on your API design.

      title: Virtualization
      description: >-
        With Mocking, you can accelerate the development of new APIs. Teams can
        work in tandem before the API is available through virtualization.
        Stoplight’s mock servers can virtualize internal and external APIs within
        your platform with dynamic responses generated from your JSON Schema,
        which can be run locally or hosted with Stoplight.

      title: Automatic Request Validation
      description: >-
        Validates requests and responses against your OpenAPI Specification.
        Simulates real server behavior by automatically validating incoming
        request headers, query strings, and request bodies against your OpenAPI
        Specification.

      title: Customizable
      description: >-
        Need a mocked response property to always be a random future date? No
        problem. Mocking can extend your OpenAPI Specification with scripts before
        or after traffic reaches your mock server. Write scripts for more complex
        mocking behavior, custom validations, and much more.
