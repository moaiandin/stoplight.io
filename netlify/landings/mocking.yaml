    Mocking your API with [Stoplight Studio](/studio/) is your API design’s perfect companion.
    Powered by [Prism](/prism), the instant [mock server](/mock-api-guide/basics/) routes
    incoming requests to example responses or dynamically generates examples on
    the fly based on your OpenAPI v2/v3 document (formerly known as Swagger).
  features:
    - description: >-
        Supercharge any OpenAPI document with [Stoplight Studio](/studio/). Once you
        have created or imported your OpenAPI document, you have access to
        an instant mock server, which automatically reloads when your
        document changes. A mock API simulates the behavior of a real API
        allowing collaboration and feedback on your API design.

        With mocking, you can accelerate the development of new APIs. Teams can
        work in tandem before the API is available through virtualization.
        Stoplight’s mock servers can virtualize internal and external APIs
        within your platform with dynamic responses generated from your JSON
        Schema, which can be run locally or hosted with Stoplight (coming soon).

        Validates requests and responses against your OpenAPI document.
        Simulates real server behavior by automatically validating incoming
        request headers, query strings, and request bodies against your OpenAPI
        document.
