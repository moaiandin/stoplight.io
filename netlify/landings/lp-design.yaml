        Get started quickly with API design-first principles. Import an existing
        API or start from scratch with a new API, zero coding required. The Visual
        Editor reduces time to get started on your API design by providing an
        intuitive UI.

        Design an API with speed and efficiency from scratch. Stoplight’s Visual
        Editor decreases the learning curve so you don’t need to be an OpenAPI
        expert to create first-class API designs. Describe endpoints, headers,
        bodies, multiple responses, query string parameters, shared models, and
        much more.

        Instantly prototype and collaborate on your API design with our
        integrated, hosted Mock Servers, powered by Prism. Mock a single API,
        multiple APIs, or even just a few endpoints. Increase efficiency by
        allowing your frontend teams to start implementation while the backend
        team develops the API.

        specification document where ever you want.
