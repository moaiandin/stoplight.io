## New ðŸš€

### Link to download your OpenAPI Specification document in your published Hub

![Checkbox to include OpenAPI document in Hub Page](/images/download-link-checkbox.png)_Checkbox to include OpenAPI document in Hub Page_

![Published Hub with link to the raw OpenAPI Specification document](/images/download-spec-link.png)_Published Hub with link to the raw OpenAPI Specification document_

Back by popular demand from Stoplight Classic!

You can now find a checkbox in your Hubâ€™s Page Settings to include a link to your raw OpenAPI Specification document in your Hub. If you are publishing your OAS document directly (not in a Hub), you can add an extension in your specification document `x-stoplight: { docs: { includeDownloadLink: true } }` to include the download link in your published API reference documentation.

### Mark endpoints as private

![Toggle button to mark an operation as private](/images/private-endpoint.png)_Toggle button to mark an operation as private_

Also back by popular demand, you can now mark operations in your specification as private to hide them from your published documentation.

> Note: This functionality wasn't added to models (although you can hide models) and doesn't remove endpoints from your OpenAPI Specification document (if the download link is included or specification is exported).
