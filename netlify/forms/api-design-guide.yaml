    Large enterprises embarking on Digital API transformation initiatives 
    are increasingly relying on API Design Management platforms in addition 
    to traditional API Management solutions to supercharge their business.


    Poor API designs lead to poor service implementations and documentation 
    which can slow down service delivery and negatively impact the ROI of 
    the initiative.


    Stoplightâ€™s mission is to enable all stakeholders working with APIs to 
    be more productive. Developing good design first practices will minimize 
    future costs, speed up your time to market, and lead to more consistent, 
    higher quality microservice and IoT applications.

        We decided to go for Stoplight because we are convinced that the API
        must be held by the business people (product owners). Before, they were
        used to designing processes or UI screens. Now, the screens are made by
        UX experts or by fintechs using our APIs. So, the product owners have to
        design the API, it's an important change, not all of them are ready.
        This is why a graphical tools is a good opportunity, perhaps the only
        one, to involve them in the design of API.
