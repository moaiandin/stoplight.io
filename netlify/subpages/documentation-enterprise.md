Stoplight offers a number of enterprise solutions for creating internal and external API documentation that is secure, fits your companies branding, and can be hosted from anywhere. Utilize our API documentation professional tool [on-premise](https://enterprise.docs.stoplight.io/) or through our SaaS web and desktop applications.

## Enterprise Security

### SAML

Utilize [Stoplight’s SAML integration](https://enterprise.docs.stoplight.io/authentication/saml) to protect your documentation while granting access to members of your organization.

### OAuth

If your API is protected by OAuth, we’ve got you covered. [Enable access](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/authorizations/oauth-hubs) through Stoplight’s integration.

### Auth0

Auth0, the popular authorization service, [integrates seamlessly into your documentation](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/authorizations/auth0) to provide a layer of protection and security. Add a login form with user access management to your documentation.

## Enterprise Branding & Design

### Theming

[Theming](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/design/theming) brings your API documentation to life. It allows you to easily modify color schemes and add textures to your documentation. There are four different theme settings that can be modified: Primary Color, Secondary Color, Background, and Texture.

### Custom CSS

Stoplight’s documentation editor provides you the freedom to customize your documentation’s [CSS](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/design/custom-css) and [Javascript](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/design/custom-js) to fit any companies branding perfectly.

## Enterprise Hosting

### Embed your Documentation into an Existing Site

Stoplight offers the necessary tools to [embed your documentation directly into an existing site](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/embed-your-hub).

### Download the Static HTML & CSS

If you would rather host your documentation outside of Stoplight’s hosted servers, you can [download a built version of your documentation](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/download-static-html). Downloading a build will produce a .zip containing all of the minified assets necessary to load your documentation. These assets will include HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON files.
