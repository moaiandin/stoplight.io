  title: OpenAPI v2 & v3 API Designer
  description: >-
    Start designing your API in minutes. Use the [OpenAPI
    Specification](/api-design-guide/openapi) (formerly known as Swagger) with
    Stoplight Studio to design consistent and standardized HTTP APIs for your
    organization. Without writing any code, model complex APIs faster than ever
    while simultaneously getting feedback on your prototypes with our
    [instant mock servers](/mocking/).
  features:
    - description: >-
        Design an API with speed and efficiency from scratch. Stoplight Studio
        decreases the learning curve so you donâ€™t need to be an OpenAPI
        expert to create first-class API designs. Describe endpoints, headers,
        bodies, multiple responses, query string parameters, shared models, and
        examples, and much more for complex APIs.

    - description: >-
        Use the Git integration with your organization's Git provider
        (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). Invite teammates, partners,
        and API consumers to view and collaborate on your API designs privately
        or publicly with the tooling you already know and use.
        <br><br>
        With Offline File Support, open an existing OpenAPI document on your local
        machine or start from scratch with a new API, zero coding required. You can
        also share your OpenAPI document where ever you want.

        Instantly prototype and collaborate on your API design with our integrated,
        instant Mock Servers, powered by [Prism](/prism). A mock API simulates the
        behavior of a real API allowing collaboration and feedback on your API
        design. Automatically update to match your API design. Mock a single API
        or multiple APIs at once.
        <br><br>
        Increase efficiency by allowing your frontend teams to start
        implementation while the backend team develops the API.

        Create API documentation in minutes. Combine OpenAPI documents with
        Markdown to create robust, searchable, internal and external
        [API documentation](/api-documentation-guide/basics) for your organization.

        Ask 100 API designers what makes a good API design and you'll get 101
        answers, but all most developers really want is consistency. Using an API
        style guide, can reduce decision making and improve consistency for all your teams.
        <br><br>
        With built-in linting and API style guides, powered by [Spectral](/spectral), Stoplight
        Studio can improve the quality of your API. You can use the default style guide, extend it, or write one to match your organization's style guide (coming soon in Studio).
